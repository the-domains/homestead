  Went outside today and lo and behold I was surrounded by Nature. Painted this

  out on the water yet and the campers hadn’t gotten up. To the fisherwomans’
  credit, we started about the same time. So I woke up at 5:30 and wanted to
  take my truck for a spin since I changed the spark plugs, and it ran
  beautifully and this struck energetic.
