  The birds sing differently in a city Three syllables instead of two on Robin's

  food, but garbage...  In lanes of space colonies with space-ships Parked in
  garages two at a time And lantern's lit against the eternal darkness That is
  perhaps the dark-side, of mankind...  Seas of woe, oceans of sorrow And the
  stars seed light to hold back their tide New life brings smiles and sojourn to
  God's eye Worlds keep company across distant space...  We trace back to fish,
  but also back to one race With one life, and one love, to keep our pace And
  soon we'll all sit on mountain top with God All having taken different paths
  up the side...  To find a vale where water runs Stars at night and smiling sun
  My soul goes there to greet some grace Where do you dream some day of peace?

# The Moon's Haloed Sky

The birds sing differently in a city  
Three syllables instead of two on Robin's tongue  
A brashing grate to a chickadee's call  
And the ravens scout not for food, but garbage...  
In lanes of space colonies with space-ships  
Parked in garages two at a time  
And lantern's lit against the eternal darkness  
That is perhaps the dark-side, of mankind...  
Seas of woe, oceans of sorrow  
And the stars seed light to hold back their tide  
New life brings smiles and sojourn to God's eye  
Worlds keep company across distant space...  
We trace back to fish, but also back to one race  
With one life, and one love, to keep our pace  
And soon we'll all sit on mountain top with God  
All having taken different paths up the side...  
To find a vale where water runs  
Stars at night and smiling sun  
My soul goes there to greet some grace  
Where do you dream some day of peace?
