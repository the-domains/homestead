<article style=""><h1>The Bending of the Flexible</h1><p>And in doing we do When through our lives Rising... maybe to you The August Summer Moon Holds cooly in sky tonight The silence pushed away mildly Seranaded by sylvan smiles Chirruping madly like moonlight Under dark sky and softened stars And where eternity meets...
