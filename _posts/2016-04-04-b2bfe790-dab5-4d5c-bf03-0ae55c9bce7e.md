My first Full Sheet done, painting 22x30"  Was fun, took me a few hours to do the whole thing, and layer... and layer... and layer...  It's more than a little curious I learned how to do art on photoshop; And now all I use photoshop for more than anything is stitching the artwork I make outside of it.  Proves Adobe's versatility I guess, more than anything.
