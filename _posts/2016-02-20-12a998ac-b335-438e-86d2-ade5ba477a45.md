Here I was trying out some hemp paper from Greenfield Paper Company.  I've been trying to find a local source for rag paper which has longer fibers, but it either comes from the French or from Malaysia.  I tried buying it from Canada, but they shipped it in from over-seas.  With the illegalization of marijuana way back when and the relegalization, they stopped making hemp rag paper which was probably used for the illegalization legislative documents.
