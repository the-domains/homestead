Ye old Mount Billiard Table rises up above the Bullriver Valley peaking back beyond in yonder Scotchman Peaks Wilderness area amidst the burned slopes and blue skies above.

Went out this morning and found a spot I could sight with and painted lightly the distant view the best I could. It was really far away! I figure maybe painting later in the day might help with some of the contrasting shadows, but I had fun painting this and watching the ducks on the bull river. I even saw a stork!
