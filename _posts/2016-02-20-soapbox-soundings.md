### The Paints of Soliloquy 

### The painting lowly clings to the wall Gripping tightly it holds the all
One world, in miniature, an instance
One can dream in
And in that world you can hold your breath
One could float and drift away from the really unreal
And the mundane crap one deals with whether dishes,
Or the perpetual problems arising from chaos
Like a sweet song will carry you away from stress
That sweet song, that caress of soul relieving...
Could be made from the bones of the world
Like this poem Simple in reflection but tied to real worlds
Like a visual vignette portraying fantasy perhaps
With reds of the sunset splaying and dripping up into sky
And blues of deep waters floating mountains rising
And greens of people playing in fields of barely seen haystacks
Blurry, textured, transmitting to you all their realness
But in that paint is power unseen
The cadmium can reside in Livers for years
The lithium could buoy up dreams of living
The rose madder could speed up metabolisms
like the brown from st. Johns wort certainly does
All if eaten and consumed
Poisonous in consumption
From the Cobalt waters to the shining sea
This thing that freed your life from misery
Could totally end it so dangerously
By the very thing that took master to create
In a tube of leaded metal 

### Isn't that existence
