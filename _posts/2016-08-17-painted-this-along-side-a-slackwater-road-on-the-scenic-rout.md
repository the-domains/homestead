  Painted this along side a slackwater road on the scenic route where the
  Clarkfork River empties out into lake Pond Oreille after a couple hundred mile
  journey through Montana. Here you can see the catchment to squirrel away the
  gray logs washed down in the Spring, and Summer, and Fall, and Winter waters
  to meet here from eastern shores.
